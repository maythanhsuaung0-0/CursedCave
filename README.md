# CursedCave
A console game application

This is a school project for NYP year 2 first term.
Option 1 to 4 is a requirement, and option 5 is an optional additional feature.
I implemented the option 5 feature as a text-based decision-making game.
The character will undergo some conditions and might need to fight a battle based on the path that he chose.
